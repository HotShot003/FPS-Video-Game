# MyFirstVideoGame

# Summary:

MyFirstGame is a first-person shooter (FPS) game built using Python and Pygame. Inspired by classic titles like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, 
the game features raycasting rendering to create a 3D-like environment and smart enemy AI using pathfinding algorithms. 
Players will navigate through levels, battling enemies and solving challenges in a retro-style FPS setting.

I have Only Use Python Programming Language and it modules That Are Pygame.
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionality for managing game windows,
drawing shapes and images, playing sounds, and handling user input.

Raycasting is a technique used in game development to create the illusion of 3D environments using 2D graphics.
It involves casting rays from the player's viewpoint and determining intersections with walls to render the scene.

# Key Features:

Raycasting Graphics: Experience a pseudo-3D environment with raycasting rendering.
Smart Enemy AI: Enemies utilize pathfinding algorithms for strategic behavior.
Classic FPS Gameplay: Move, shoot, and interact in a nostalgic FPS format.


# Controls:

W, A, S, D: Move forward, left, backward, right.
Mouse: Look around.
Left Click: Shoot.
